 "This is my first project. I used JavaScript to create a maze. It has animations that show how the maze is generated."

"This project uses vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas to generate random mazes. It also animates the generation process, and no external libraries are required."

No external dependencies: Uses only vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas (or DOM), no need to import libraries like jQuery or Vue.
Single-file design: All logic (maze generation, rendering, animation) is concentrated in one JS file for easy reading and modification.
Clear visualization: Uses different colors to distinguish maze walls, paths, start points/end points (you can add your color scheme here).
(Optional) Interactive support: Click a button to regenerate the maze / adjust the maze size (add this based on your actual features).
